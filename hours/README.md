## ~~VBScript~~ Ruby Script to Keep track of Hours Worked...

This is a little script I use to keep track of how
many hours I've worked this week. Minimally
featured, it's just fun.

### Usage

- [ ] `cl` - display hours worked this week/remaining
- [ ] `cl in` - clock in at the current date/time
- [ ] `cl out` - clock out at the current date/time
- [ ] `cl {in|out} hh:mm` - clock in or out today at X time
- [ ] `cl {in|out} hh:mm dd/mm/YYYY` - clock in or out
at a certain date etc.
- [ ] `cl fill {dd/mm/YYYY}` - fill today (or input
date) with a blank (holiday or sick) day
