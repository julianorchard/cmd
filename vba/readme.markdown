## Excel VBA Scripts

A few Excel VBA Scripts I used to keep in a repo
of their own, but they're not really important
enough to be on their own, and I think they're
just fine in this repo. Includes scripts for
detecting changes/clicks in a range of cells, some
scripts for printing the spreadsheet (usually
using a button), and emailing directly from the
sheet! 

Just copy paste functions into your sheets to
implement (I can't think of a better way than
this, and it doesn't really require anything more
complex than that anyway...).
